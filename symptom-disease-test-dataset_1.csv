"The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years. But for some people, signs and symptoms develop suddenly. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: GH GH  Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as:  Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding  Men may also have symptoms such as:  Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: TSH  Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: ACTH  Severe fatigue Low blood pressure, which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion  Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: ADH  Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances  Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding.",507

"Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. They typically occur with a medical problem. Symptoms often come and go during the day. There may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital. Primary symptoms include the following. Reduced awareness of surroundings This may result in:  Trouble focusing on a topic or changing topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions Being easily distracted Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings  Poor thinking skills This may appear as:  Poor memory, such as forgetting recent events Not knowing where they are or who they are Trouble with speech or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Trouble reading or writing  Behavior and emotional changes These may include:  Anxiety, fear or distrust of others Depression A short temper or anger A sense of feeling elated Lack of interest and emotion Quick changes in mood Personality changes Seeing things that others don't see Being restless, anxious or combative Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults Slowed movement or being sluggish Changes in sleep habits A switched night-day sleep-wake cycle  Types of delirium Experts have identified three types:  Hyperactive delirium. This may be the easiest type to recognize. People with this type may be restless and pace the room. They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. People with this type often resist care. Hypoactive delirium. People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. They might seem to be in a daze. They don't interact with family or others. Mixed delirium. Symptoms involve both types of delirium. The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish.  Delirium and dementia Delirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years. Delirium often occurs in people with dementia. However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include:  Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time — within a day or two. Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. Rapid changes in symptoms. Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level.

"There are three general types of thoracic outlet syndrome:  Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome. This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known as an aneurysm.  It's possible to have a mix of the three different types of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple parts of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, signs and symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:  Numbness or tingling in your arm or fingers Pain or aches in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand Weakening grip  Signs and symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include:  Discoloration of your hand (bluish color) Arm pain and swelling Blood clot in veins in the upper area of your body Arm fatigue with activity Paleness or abnormal color in one or more fingers or your hand Throbbing lump near your collarbone  Signs and symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:  Cold fingers, hands or arms Hand and arm pain Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your fingers or your entire hand Weak or no pulse in the affected arm ",981

"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include:  Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.

"There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound. How twins are joined Conjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. Each pair of conjoined twins is unique. Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:  Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs. Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare. Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.  In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu).",243

"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms. When they do, signs and symptoms can include:  Stomach ulcers Heartburn Diabetes Weakness Fatigue Muscle cramps Indigestion Diarrhea Weight loss Skin rash Constipation Pain in your abdomen or back Yellowing of your skin or eyes Low blood sugar  Causes It's not clear what causes most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occur when hormone-producing cells in the pancreas (islet cells) develop changes (mutations) in their DNA — the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body. DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions. One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells. Sometimes the cancer cells break away and spread to other organs, such as the liver. Some inherited syndromes increase the risk of this type of cancer, including:  Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau disease Von Recklinghausen's disease (neurofibromatosis 1) Tuberous sclerosis  Risk factors Factors that are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors include:  Being male. Men are much more likely than women to develop these tumors. A family history of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. If a family member was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, your risk is increased. You may have multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome, which increases the risk of this type of tumor.

"Children get the same types of headaches adults do, but their symptoms may be a little different. For example, migraine pain in adults often lasts at least four hours — but in children, the pain may not last as long. Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can't describe symptoms. In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently into certain categories. Migraine Migraines can cause:  Pulsating or throbbing head pain Pain that worsens with activity Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Extreme sensitivity to light and sound  Even infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry or rock back and forth to indicate severe pain. Tension-type headache Tension-type headaches can cause:  A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head Pain that's not worsened by physical activity Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine  Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days. Cluster headache Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually:  Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation  Chronic daily headache Doctors use the phrase ""chronic daily headache"" (CDH) for migraines and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month. CDH may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications — even nonprescription pain medications — too often.",444

"Signs and symptoms of a tension-type headache include:  Dull, aching head pain Sensation of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles  Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic. Episodic tension-type headaches Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches may become chronic. Chronic tension-type headaches This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be continuous. If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic. Tension-type headaches versus migraines Tension-type headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines. Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you can also have migraines. Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse. An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension-type headache, but this symptom isn't common.",974

"If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you:  Prefer being alone and choose to do activities alone Don't want or enjoy close relationships Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships Feel like you can't experience pleasure Have difficulty expressing emotions and reacting appropriately to situations May seem humorless, indifferent or emotionally cold to others May appear to lack motivation and goals Don't react to praise or critical remarks from others  Schizoid personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood, though some features may be noticeable during childhood. These features may cause you to have trouble functioning well in school, a job, socially or in other areas of life. However, you may do reasonably well in your job if you mostly work alone. Schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia Although a different disorder, schizoid personality disorder can have some similar symptoms to schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, such as a severely limited ability to make social connections and a lack of emotional expression. People with these disorders may be viewed as odd or eccentric. Even though the names may sound similar, unlike schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, people with schizoid personality disorder:  Are in touch with reality, so they're unlikely to experience paranoia or hallucinations Make sense when they speak (although the tone may not be lively), so they don't have conversational patterns that are strange and hard to follow  When to see a doctor People with schizoid personality disorder usually only seek treatment for a related problem, such as depression. If someone close to you has urged you to seek help for symptoms common to schizoid personality disorder, make an appointment with a health care or mental health professional. If you suspect a loved one may have schizoid personality disorder, gently suggest that the person seek medical attention. It might help to offer to go along to the first appointment.",881

"Signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops gradually and produces symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the disease may be discovered only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. General symptoms Sarcoidosis can begin with these signs and symptoms:  Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Weight loss Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles  Lung symptoms Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as:  Persistent dry cough Shortness of breath Wheezing Chest pain  Skin symptoms Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include:  A rash of red or reddish-purple bumps, usually located on the shins or ankles, which may be warm and tender to the touch Disfiguring sores (lesions) on the nose, cheeks and ears Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color Growths under the skin (nodules), particularly around scars or tattoos  Eye symptoms Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it's important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye signs and symptoms do occur, they may include:  Blurred vision Eye pain Burning, itching or dry eyes Severe redness Sensitivity to light  Heart symptoms      Cardiac sarcoidosis: A heart under attack   Click here for an infographic to learn more        Cardiac sarcoidosis: A heart under attack   Click here for an infographic to learn more Signs and symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include:  Chest pain Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) Rapid or fluttering heart beat (palpitations) Swelling caused by excess fluid (edema)  Sarcoidosis can also affect calcium metabolism, the nervous system, the liver and spleen, muscles, bones and joints, the kidneys, lymph nodes, or any other organ.",875

"Most thyroid nodules don't cause signs or symptoms. But occasionally some nodules become so large that they can:  Be felt Be seen, often as a swelling at the base of your neck Press on your windpipe or esophagus, causing shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing  In some cases, thyroid nodules produce additional thyroxine, a hormone secreted by your thyroid gland. The extra thyroxine can cause symptoms of an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism), such as:  Unexplained weight loss Increased sweating Tremor Nervousness Rapid or irregular heartbeat  Only a small number of thyroid nodules are cancerous.

Possible symptoms include severe pain in or around one eye or on one side of your head. There may be tearing, nasal stuffiness and a runny nostril on the affected side of the head. A cluster headache strikes quickly, usually without warning, although you might first have migraine-like nausea and aura. Common signs and symptoms during a headache include:  Excruciating pain that is generally situated in, behind or around one eye, but may radiate to other areas of your face, head and neck One-sided pain Restlessness Excessive tearing Redness of your eye on the affected side Stuffy or runny nose on the affected side Forehead or facial sweating on the affected side Pale skin (pallor) or flushing on your face Swelling around your eye on the affected side Drooping eyelid on the affected side  People with cluster headache, unlike those with migraine, are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. Some migraine-like symptoms — including sensitivity to light and sound — can occur with a cluster headache, though usually on one side. Cluster period characteristics A cluster period generally lasts for several weeks to months. The starting date and the duration of each cluster period might be consistent from period to period. For example, cluster periods can occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall. Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period lasting 3 months or longer before another cluster headache develops. Chronic cluster periods might continue for more than a year, or pain-free periods might last less than one month. During a cluster period:  Headaches usually occur every day, sometimes several times a day A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours The attacks often occur at the same time each day Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after you go to bed  The pain usually ends as suddenly as it began, with rapidly decreasing intensity. After attacks, most people are pain-free but exhausted.",225

"The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include:  Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. Organ meats. Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.  Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include:  Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. Wheezing or shortness of breath. Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.  The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.",36

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:  Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.  Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:  Withdrawal from friends and family A drop in performance at school Trouble sleeping Irritability or depressed mood Lack of motivation  Also, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be:  Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations ",882

Signs and symptoms include:  Bleeding easily Bruising easily Fatigue Poor appetite Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Dark-colored urine Itchy skin Fluid buildup in your abdomen (ascites) Swelling in your legs Weight loss Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy) Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas)  Every chronic hepatitis C infection starts with an acute phase. Acute hepatitis C usually goes undiagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms. When signs and symptoms are present, they may include jaundice, along with fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches. Acute symptoms appear one to three months after exposure to the virus and last two weeks to three months. Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic. Some people clear HCV from their bodies after the acute phase, an outcome known as spontaneous viral clearance. In studies of people diagnosed with acute HCV, rates of spontaneous viral clearance have varied from 15% to 25%. Acute hepatitis C also responds well to antiviral therapy.",466

"Adults and children who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is known as ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. LDL This excess cholesterol is sometimes deposited in certain portions of the skin, some tendons and around the iris of the eyes:  Skin. The most common spots for cholesterol deposits to occur is on the hands, elbows and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes. Tendons. Cholesterol deposits may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendons in the hands. Eyes. High cholesterol levels can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia.  Causes Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene alteration that's passed down from one or both parents. People who have this condition are born with it. This change prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease. Risk factors The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parents have the gene alteration that causes it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including:  Ashkenazi Jews Some Lebanese groups French Canadians  Complications People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age. Heart attacks may occur before age 50 in men and age 60 in women. The rarer and more severe variety of the condition, if undiagnosed or untreated, can cause death before age 20.

"Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel. Hypomanic symptoms Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include:  An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Irritable or agitated behavior Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Tendency to be easily distracted Inability to concentrate  Depressive symptoms Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include:  Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Irritability, especially in children and teenagers Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Sleep problems Restlessness Fatigue or feeling slowed down Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide ",263

"Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease dementia. But unlike Alzheimer's disease, the most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss. Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include:  Confusion Trouble paying attention and concentrating Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others Slowed thinking Difficulty with organization Difficulty deciding what to do next Problems with memory Restlessness and agitation Unsteady gait Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine Depression or apathy  Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia. Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia. But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia. What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together. Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.",1048
